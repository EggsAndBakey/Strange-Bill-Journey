THIS IS WHERE YOU SHOULD PUT THE MUSIC.
PUTTING MUSIC ANYWHERE ELSE IS CONFUSING AND I WOULD ADVISE AGAINST DOING THAT.
IF IT'S LEVEL MUSIC, PUT IT IN data/audio/music/level/insert folder name here
IF IT'S MENU MUSIC, PUT IT IN data/audio/music/menu
IF YOU WANT TO ADD MUSIC, MAKE SURE IT'S EITHER .MP3 OR .OGG! .WAV IS TOO LARGE AND IT WILL JUST MAKE THE SIZE OF THE GAME LARGER THAN IT SHOULD BE!
